We're going to make Home.js be the user's profile.

First, we connect Home.js to the store.

User was added to the store because via:
  Login.js -> actions/auth.js -> reducers/user.js

Adam likes to start by building the component part first.

But now we're going to add posts, so add 'posts' stuff to reducers/index.js
...and then write the reducers/posts.js reducer
